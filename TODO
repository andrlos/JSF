TODO (what the framework should do):

- test that given set of rpms (jdk x os x arch) satisfies:

	* names of the pkgs are as expected
	* priority check
	 	* debugpackage have lower than normal ones, contains version/release, length is known, prefix is known
	* master and postinstall test
	    * contains correct set of masters for each pkg
	    * postinstall script only in packages that are supposed to have it
	* all subpackages are present
	* download single-arch (+noarch) parts of build from brew/koji
	* none subpackage is empty unless expected
	- check config files are as expected
	    - some of them are now in /etc/java/java-version-vendor/nvra
	x provides and obsolaetes (and requires?) are as expected
	* plugin, javaws, jcontrol sanity
		* if plugin pkg is present, then javaws and jcontrol, ControlPanel files should be in that pkg
		* if plugin pkg is present, then it should provide javaws and jcontrol, ControlPanel
	* broken symlinks
	* alternatives are correct
	* alternatives and binaries in bin or jre/bin are correct
	* man page corresponds to existing manpages, to alternatives and to binaries in bin jre/bin
	- desktop shortcuts are sane
	x all connections of  binaries x desktop files x alternatives are sane
	x download whole build from brew/koji (a set of rpms for each arch) and check:
		- correct set of architectures is present
		- test each architecture separately
	- check that everything that postinstall script adds is removed when uninstalled - no idea how

    * versionless/versionfull link check - subdirectories in usr/lib/jre/nvra - n - nv -nvr ...
    * executable permission (slave 755)
    * path test - if all the binaries are in at least one $PATH directory
        * if is in more, check that binary links are identical
        TODO:
        this test uses binaries from BinaryTest. Since there are few special cases, this test currently does not
        check some binaries:
        ITW: itweb-settings.itweb binary has ControlPanel slave - both is deleted from slave/bin list, IS NOT CHECKED
        * JDK: care for policytool, check if it works out after refactoring
        * IBM: haven't tested yet, might fail on some plugin binaries - no binaries are removed
        * ORACLE: jmc.ini - has no slave, should not have link in $PATH???? - should not
    * generate another logfile, where only test fails will be logged.

* generate in human-readable form, what it itself test
- rpm can list %ghosts - if file exists, package "owns it" - bins, slaves, mpges
- rpms own all files that they create
  - rpm -ql java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless
  - + all of the directories in the system

- todo
x work inprogress
* done

notes:
	for sake of this testsuite, ITW is considered as special jdk, with plugin package only
	decide whether to use static analys of scripelts, or apply in chroot
		static analys is easy and faset, but error prone
		installing to chroot is very errorproof, but very time consuming

minor_tasks:
- check /etc/ directory - all config files from rpm (some query gets them) must be in etc and linked from jdk (idk how
  does it work for rhel7)
* rename mock_executor install script snapshots to something more bug-proof
* binary test - policytool can be handled by small methods overriding each other in OpenJdk6/7/8 classes
* for anything but postinstall check, there should be a workaround so we do not check anything but default and
  devel pkg, might speed up the tests a little bit
* delete all ibm6 testcases
* refactor postinstall test
* fix doc bug
* refactor strings in binary test and manpage test, should be in methods
* utils could contain a log methods file, that would contain logging methods to get rid of the strings.
* extract regularly used constants to a single file
* subpackages test misses else throw exceptions in setCSCH at vendors etc.
* fix mock - if there is locked root or vm, it sometimes behaves like all the tests have passed. Must fail immidiately
  though
- there are some magic errors while trying to download builds from koji or brew, appear only when run in virtualbox
- plugin binaries might not be checked - the master binary located somewhere usr/lib/plugin....
* rework logs, add verbosity option, refactor the framework accordingly
 fix the bug in jdk8 binary test, with openjfxpackages dependencies
- mock is very unreliable and tends to crash randomly on installs. if does so, it should be at least checked somewhere
- fix scriptlet test
- check fails:
   - ITW f27 - InitTest.test_nativeArches[Non_Arch]
             - PostinstallScriptTest.test_contains_postscript[Non_Arch]
   * ITW f26 - SubpackagesTest.test_checkAllSubpackages[AllArchs] (OBSOLETE)
   - ojdk8 rhel7 - PostinstallScriptTest.test_contains_postscript[ppc64le, aarch64, ppc64]
                 - SubpackagesTest.test_checkAllSubpackages[ppc64le, aarch64, ppc64]
* adaption of the framework from debug to slowdebug (must accept debug for jdk <10 and slowdebug for jdk >=10)
- fix the permission test so it does not reach out of /usr/lib/jvm
  + do not forget about /etc/java (in more than only this test!!!)
- tests that crash on exceptions are still sometimes counted as unstable

FUTURE PLANS:
- libjavaplugin will be unvailable f27+ => RHEL 8 +, all ibm and oracle java will have to get a new master
  for its plugin subpackages / plugin slaves.....

* testsuite needs to be reworked, so each failed test counts as one, so we can see the improvement and number of fails more
  accurate

   rpms = self.getBuild()
        assert rpms is not None
        assert len(rpms) > 1
 -- good idea for test, but was on bad spot
